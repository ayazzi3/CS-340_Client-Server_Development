How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Breaking code into smaller, well-defined components is an effective approach to enhancing maintainability, readability, and adaptability. In my CRUD module for Project One, each CRUD operation was structured as an individual function, fostering modularity and simplifying its use throughout the semester. Keeping CRUD operations in a separate module not only encourages code reuse in future projects but also minimizes redundancy and makes maintenance significantly easier compared to integrating them into a larger file.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When tackling a problem as a computer scientist, some of the most effective strategies include:
Gaining a clear understanding of the requirements
Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable solutions
Continuously refining and improving solutions based on feedback and evolving requirements
Conducting research to identify existing solutions that can be leveraged
Collaborating with the team to promote effective communication and teamwork

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
By applying core computer science principles, a computer scientist can enhance project efficiency through automation and process optimization. They can also support decision-making by providing expert insights and developing data visualizations to present information more effectively.
